This folder contains the articles I've written for user communities with the intent of reducing support tickets by providing solutions to common issues and tasks.<br>

These articles have all been recreated in markdown. The original articles, as published on the community site, are linked at the top of each document. I've used this exercise as a way to practice markdown syntax as well as make edits to the original articles. Most of the edits are formatting-related for readability, but I've also made updates to word choices for accessibility and brevity.
