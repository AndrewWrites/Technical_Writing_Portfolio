# **Transfer Support Cases Between Support Engineers**

## **Purpose**
This document covers the correct procedure for transferring a support case from one  Customer Support Engineer (CSE) to another.

## **Overview**
In most cases, the CSE who is assigned to the case is responsible for working it to completion. However, there will be times when a case needs to be transferred to another CSE, potentially in a different global region. The handoff between CSEs is critical to ensure minimal impact on the customer.

## **Transferring Within the Same Region**
There are a few situations when transferring a case to another CSE in the same global region is necessary.

The following situations are acceptable reasons to transfer a case within the same global region:

1. You are taking extended time off and have cases that cannot be closed.
2. You will be out for a couple of days and have an urgent issue that needs to be watched.
3. You have a high priority case that requires a subject matter expert to resolve.

## **Transferring Between Regions**
There are some situations where a case may need to be transferred between global regaions (APAC, EMEA, North America).

Acceptable reasons for transferring a case between global regions include:

1. High priority cases that need continual user support.
2. Customer needs support in a time zone that cannot be served by assigned CSE. 

## **Must Dos when Transferring a Case**
There are several steps to take before transferring a case to another CSE.

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth handoff:

1. Update the case notes with current status and actions needed.
2. Speak to your supervisor to discuss who should take over and why.
3. Speak to the CSE who will take over the case.
4. Contact the customer to inform them of the handoff.
5. Reassign the case.

Use the template below to ensure all required details are in the case notes for the next CSE:
- PASS TO: What region is this case being passed to?
- REASON: Why is the case being transferred. What is the value add to the customer? Is any language skill needed?
- ISSUE: What is the problem faced by the customer?
- STEPS TRIED: What have you already done to try and resolve the issue?
- NEXT STEPS: What does the CSE taking over need to do? (Web meeting, wait for logs, etc)
- NEXT CUSTOMER CONTACT: Is the customer waiting for us or are we waiting for them? Make note of the customer's time zone.

## **What If I am Unable to Find Someone to Take Over?**
If you are unable to find someone to take over the case for you, talk to your supervisor. They can help you find someone and may take over the case themselves as a placehoder if needed. Do **not** transfer the case to your supervisor without talking to them first.
