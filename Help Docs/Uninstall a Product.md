## **Uninstall a Product**

The Alteryx installer removes an existing product when you perform a full install of the same product. For example, when you perform a full install of admin Designer, the installer removes a previously installed version of admin Designer. The same is true for other Alteryx products like Alteryx Intelligence Suite and the Alteryx Predictive Tools.

If you  need to remove a product and are not installing a new version, the process is slightly different. To remove an Alteryx product that you no longer need, you need to manually u ninstall the product. The process is the same for all Alteryx products.

To manually uninstall an Alteryx product...
1. On your Windows machine, go to **Add or Remove Programs**
   You can type it in the taskbar search box, or navigate to **Programs and Features** from the **Control Panel**
2. Choose the Alteryx product to uninstall.
3. Select **Uninstall**.
4. The Alteryx installer removes the selected product.
